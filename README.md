"Hemingway Mode" emulates the experience of typing on a typewrite. You can only add text to the document, and only at the end. You cannot make selections, you cannot move the cursor, and you cannot backspace.

It was once said, 'Do not try to create and analyze at the same time. They are different processes.' Hemingway mode forces you to create now and edit later.

Simple.
